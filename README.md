FinalProject_group032.ipynb contains the finished project.

Final projects for COGS 108: Data Science in Practice.
Group project based on our proposal that city spendings in different categories is correlated with rates of sexual assault.

Found a dataset in the wild for both rates of assault and city spending.
Cleaned the data into a usable form that we desired.
Analyzed the data to look for possible correlation.
Found no correlation for any factors, decided it would be most helpful to have more granular city spending for social programs as a future project.
